# Car_Price_Prediction
I made a model to predict car prices 
📌 Project Overview 
This project focuses on building a Car Price Prediction model to estimate the selling prices of used cars based on various car features. By analyzing factors like car model, make, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and other essential attributes, this model predicts the estimated selling price for a car. The project is valuable for car dealerships and customers alike, helping them make data-driven pricing decisions.

# 🚀 Models Used
Multiple machine learning models were implemented and compared to find the best-performing algorithm:

# Linear Regression
# Decision Tree,  Random Forest (achieved highest accuracy at 93%) The Random Forest model was selected as the final model due to its high accuracy and robust performance on test data.

# ⚙️ Key Features
Web Interface: A simple, user-friendly web interface was created using Flask. Users can enter car details through the interface, which returns an estimated price based on the input features. Data Preprocessing: Various data preprocessing techniques were applied to handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale features to improve model accuracy. 📊 Evaluation The model’s accuracy and performance were evaluated based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). With its 93% accuracy, the Random Forest model demonstrated the best balance between bias and variance.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python for data manipulation and model training Scikit-Learn for model building Flask for web deployment Pandas & NumPy for data processing Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations #💻 How to Use Clone the repository and install dependencies. Run the Flask application. Access the web interface to input car details and get a price prediction. This project highlights skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deploying models through a web application.
